# Naive-Bayes
Naive Bayes is a kind of classifier that uses the Bayes Theorem. It predicts membership probabilities for each class such as the probability that a given record or data point belongs to a particular class. The class with the highest probability is considered the most likely class. This project involves splitting data into Train and cross-validation(or test): Stratified Sampling, making data model ready: encoding essay, and project_title, making data model ready: encoding numerical, categorical features, and lastly applying NB on different kinds of featurization and summarizing the models. Some of the libraries used in this project are NumPy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, nltk, seaborn, pickle, and tqdm.
